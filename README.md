# Data Mining and Statistical Learning
 Homework and Projects from MATH 6350 Graduate Course
___
This is a repository of all homeworks and projects created in my Graduate Data Mining and Statistical Learning course in Fall 2021. Files in this repository are of R files, PDF reports, and Jupyter notebooks from the machine learning topics that are learned in class. These are all homework assignments that are given out through the semester. This repository contains a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. 

___
The notebook contains two main languages to create machine learning projects that of Python and R. We have selected to do various projects in these two languages in the goal to learn how algorithms work in each given language. 

The following book found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370/ref=pd_sbs_3/144-6794220-9343026?pd_rd_w=rGHAX&pf_rd_p=0a3ad226-8a77-4898-9a99-63ffeb1aef90&pf_rd_r=XNYTR15VT5KTH3A3B67V&pd_rd_r=9d218bca-af2d-4bb6-be5e-75c0aa853ac3&pd_rd_wg=KnQb8&pd_rd_i=1461471370&psc=1) is the book that is used in this class and of which the projects and models are based from. 

___


The projects in this class include but not limited to the following algorithms:

<li> K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
<li> K-Means Clustering </li>
<li> Random Forest</li>
<li> Support Vector Machines</li>

___

Within many of these algorithms, the following topics may be covered:

<li> Using Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality reduction</li>
<li> Partition of data for training and testing</li>
<li> Performance Measures of errors with confidence intervals </li>
<li> The use of markdown and LaTeX encoding to write files   </li>
<li> Inbalance Class Amplification  </li>
<li> Train and test performance evaluation   </li>

This class is taught at the University of Houston by Dr. Robert Azencott - Professor of Mathematics.

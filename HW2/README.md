## Homework 2 - K Nearest Neighbor with PCA

For this second homework assignment 2, we focus on working with the a zip file of packages found on the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository,of the given package, [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Font+Images). This package contains 153 fonts of each 20x20 pixel representation. For this homework we are to select 4 fonts to create a classifier to predict the given font using the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm. We then applied PCA on to the given datasets reduce the size while encapsulating a large portion of the data. 


This project was done in collaboration with two other students in this Graduate School Program. The following two names are of the students whom, worked on the homework. Basel Najjar and Soo Jong Cho


<ul>
<li>The project has three parts of: </li>
<ul>
<li>Selecting the data from 4 fonts and explore each one of the given font and the data that it may contain. </li>
<li>Create a KNN model on the dataset as a whold to predict one of four classes that we have selected.</li>
<li>Apply PCA on the given dataset to reduce the dimensions of the dataset while applying the KNN model to the dataset again after the transformation. </li>
</ul>

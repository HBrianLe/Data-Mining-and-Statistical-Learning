## Homework 1 - K Nearest Neighbor

For this first homework assignment 1, we focus on working with the Auto Dataset found within the package ISLR, a link to the given dataset can be found [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/ISLR/man/Auto.html). Within this homework we explore the given dataset in the goal of predicting the possible class of a car of being LOW, MED, or HIGH MPG classification. 


This project was done in collaboration with two other students in this Graduate School Program. The following two names are of the students whom, worked on the homework. Basel Najjar and Soo Jong Cho

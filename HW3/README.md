## Homework 3 - Random Forest and K means Classifier 

For this second homework assignment 3, we focus on working with the a zip file of packages found on the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository,of the given package, [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Font+Images). This package contains 153 fonts of each 20x20 pixel representation. For this homework we are to select 4 fonts to create a classifier to predict the given font using random forest and k means algorithm. 


This project was done in collaboration with two other students in this Graduate School Program. The following two names are of the students whom, worked on the homework. Basel Najjar and Soo Jong Cho

<ul>
<li>The project has three parts of: </li>
<ul>
<li>Selecting the data from 4 fonts and explore each one of the given font and the data that it may contain. </li>
<li>Create a Random Forest model on the data set to predict the correct type of font</li>
<li>Attempt to use K Means Algorithm to improve the performance of the Random forest model</li>
</ul>
